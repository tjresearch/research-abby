# Project Title - No Clue Yet

Our current legal system (theoretically) works toward providing equal, fair opportunities for all American citizens, but how effective these laws are at changing American culture proves to be a complicated relationship. By using NLP on books written during specific eras, we can gain insight into the culture during that time period and compare it to the laws governing it. My project focuses on one type of discrimination (sexism) to investigate the relationship between the American legal system and its cultural values.
